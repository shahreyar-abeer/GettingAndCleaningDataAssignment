# GettingAndCleaningDataAssignment

This repository processes the raw data obtained from the experiment "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" and produces a tidy data set.  

In this experiment, six human activities namely walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying are considered. A group of 30 volunteers' activities have been recorded using a smartphone(Samsung Galaxy SII) over a certain period of time.  

A raw data is thus obtained. In order to work with the data, a tidy data set is required and this is the purpose of this repository. It contains a file named *run_analysis.R* which performs the necessary steps required to get a tidy data set from the raw data. The script is written in **R**. It also contains a *Codebook* which explains all the variables present in the data set and also the process through which  the tidy data set is obtained.
